# CreActive: Getting creative about Deep Neural Networks activation functions

The main goal of this GitHub repo is to host code used to perform some **quick experiments** regarding **activation functions** in Deep **Neural Networks**.

Specifically, the following ideas were tested:

* **Replacing** non-linear layers of pre-trained Neural Netwotk with **different** non-linearities
* **Removing** activation function of pre-trained Neural Network at **inference time**
